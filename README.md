# NASA-app : Made with React

This app is able to display new images and details from the NASA APOD API everyday. A nice showing of frontend skills.

## Things I learned from this project

Skills learned: 
How to...
* Pull data from an API to display nicely in a React frontend
* Cache data from API calls as to not incur costs or exceed call limits
